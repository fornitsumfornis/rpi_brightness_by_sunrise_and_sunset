# RPI brightness by sunrise and sunset times
This set of scripts changes the brightness dipslay of the 7" Raspberry Pi touchscreen by syncing with the local sunrise and sunset times.

## Distributions

Raspbian
Ubuntu Mate for ARM

It should run on other distributions (such as pidora) but I have not tested it beyond these two distros.

## Dependencies

This package depends on lynx.  
sudo apt-get install lynx -y
