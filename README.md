# rpi_brightness_by_sunrise_and_sunset
This set of scripts changes the brightness dipslay of the 7" Raspberry Pi touchscreen by syncing with the local sunrise and sunset times.

It currently will run on Raspbian and also Ubuntu Mate for the ARM.  It should run on other distributions (such as pidora) but I have not tested it beyond these two distros.

I will update and enhance this package when time permits.
